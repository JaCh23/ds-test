1037,THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR HER TO ANNOUNCE IT TO THE ENTIRE COMP
1038,THE CRIMINALS AN TE THE GLES OF THE SURTAN PRIVLAR
1039,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
1040,THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK BUT HE WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CONCENTRATE
1041,CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT THAT'S A CRAY
1042,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES
1043,THEY WENT IN TO DRINK THE TEA WHICH WAS SERVED IN BEAUTIFUL CRYSTAL GLASSES

1053,THE BOY PUT TO STONES IN HIS POUCH
1054,THAT HE WANTED TO TRAVEL
1055,I WENT STRETCHING MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY WAY INTO THE DARK

1195,YOU CAN'T LET THE CHRONICLE GET THE LAUGH ON US
1196,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASH FLOAT
1197,WHEN HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE DUNE HIS HEART LEAPT

1248,THE SHOP FOLK WES STACKING DOWN THE SHUTTERS AND PEOPLE WERE OPENING THE BALDROOM WINDOW
1249,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FALLEN MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
1250,THE TROUBLE WITH USING THIS FOR ALL ONSTREING MOMENT IS THAT RECOGNITION ACCURACY ISN'T ALWAYS PERFECT

1348,SEEMS LIKE AT HOT BE FIXIBLE IN SOFT WALE
1349,MOSTLY JUST THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO REALIZE THEIR DESTINIES
1350,ITHER JUST WATCH HIM HE'S SENT  HIMSE
1351,THE EXECUTION WAS CANCELLED
1352,CERTAINLY IAM SURE I AM COMFORTABLE
1353,THIS IS WHAT I WISHED FOR
1354,THE NIGHT WAS WARM AND I WAS THIRSTY
1355,THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
1356,ALL THINGS ARE ONE
1357,THE WALLS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PASTE
1358,I AM PROUD OF YOU HE SAID
1359,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
1360,A HUGE HOLE HAD BEEN MADE BY THE IMPACT OF THE PROJECTILE
1361,AND I'M GOING TO BE ALL THINGS
1362,I KNEW THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE
1363,WILL YOU GET CLOSE TO HIM
1364,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
1365,SINCE THE MINER HAD SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO HIS DESTINY THE OLD MAN DECIDED TO BECOME INVALVED
1366,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THA DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAINS RINGING AND RUMBLING
1367,THE THING ITSELF WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY BURIED IN SAND
1368,DRAWING FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNER OF ENGLISH AND GERMAN I VALUE ENGAGING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE EVERY DAY CONVERSATION
1369,THE ANNIMALS WERE EXHAUSTED AND THE MEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES LESS AND LESS
1370,WALK IN THE GRASS AN MY BARE FEET
1371,THE OLD MAN WAS PROBABLY A GIPSY TOO
1372,IF WE SERVE TEA AND CRYSTEL THE SHOP IS GOING TO EXPAND
1373,SO HOW WILL WE NAME ALL THESE HURRICANES
1374,BECAUSE LIFE WANTS YOU TO ASHIV YOU DESINE
1375,
1376,EVERYONE SEEMED VERY EXCITED
1377,THERE'S A CARAVAN LEAVING TO DAY FOR AL FALUM
1378,VIBRATIONS OF PEACE THREW OUT THE TENT
1379,THE HONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF FU SCATTERN PINE TREE
1380,BEACON PINE CAKES AND MEEPLE SILUP AS A HEARTY START TO ANY DE

1382,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
1383,THE ELECTRICIAN LOOK PUZZLED
1384,I BET YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THOSE
1385,SO THE WIND BLEW WITH ALL ITS STRENGTH AND THE SKY WAS FILLED WITH SAND
1386,WHEN CAME ROMANCE OF THE FORST FALLEN STAR
1387,WHERE'S THE TREASURE HE ASKED
1388,IT IS I THE BOY ANSWERED
1389,WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT

1391,THEY WENT ON SMOKING THE PIPE FOR A WHILE AS THE SUN BEGAN TO SET
1392,HE HAD COME TO THE TOWN ONLY TO FIND A WOMAN WHO COULD INTERPRET HIS DREAM
1393,WHEN HE WAS IN HOSPITAL THE NURSE TOOK AN EXRAY PHOTOGRAPH OF HIS AUM
1394,HE WONDERED FAREWELL KEEPING THE DEAD PALMS OF THE ISES WITHIN SIGHT
1395,AND THEN HE PERCEIVED IT VERY SLOWLY
1396,HITTING THE DILY AND ESCAPEKEYS DID NOTHING
1397,AND EVENTUALLY MEN WILL NOURISH YOUR SAMS WHERE THE GAME WILL ONCE AGAIN FLOURISH
1398,HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET HIM EXAMINED
1399,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
1400,ABOUT ELEVEN I WALKED BACK TO MY HOME IN NABORY BECAUSE NOTHING SEEMED TO BE HAPPENING
1401,THEY WERE MEN OF THE DESERT AND THEY WERE FEARFUL OF SORCERERS

1404,SOMETHING TERRIBLES HAPPEN TO ME
1405,I HAD A FAINT MOVEMENT UNDER MY FEET
1406,HENDERSEN STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
1407,BUT HE DECIDED FIRST TO BUY HIS BAKERY AND PUT SOME MONEY ASIDE
1408,ONLY WE CALL THEM AGENTS
1409,WHY THE SHOT STORE AFTER THE TENTH NO ONE ON EARTH HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
1410,HOW THEY MANAGE TO IMPROVISE AS SUCH SHORT NOTICE SHE'LL NEVER KNOW
1411,AND THAT AS A POE OF LAW COMES IN
1412,THY WERE LOOKING ONLY FOR GAL HIS COMPANION ANSWERED

1416,SO WHAT IS SALIM LIKE HE ASKED TRYING TO GET SOME SORT OF CLUE
1417,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERYONE COULD HEAR HIM
1418,MAYHIL OF THE SUN ON STA
1419,THE DESART DIDN'T ANSWER HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS
1420,JANET ROGER DIED THREE MONTHS AGO
1421,AND IN THAT WAY THE MONTHS PASSED
1422,WHAT WULL USE IT WILL GIVING THEM A DRANK IN THE ROOM
1423,I THOUGHT ABOUT WHETHER WE SHOULD FIND COINS AND MEBLES IN IT AND SO ON

1425,WE COULD GET TO THE PYRAMIDS BY TO MORROW SAID THE OUVER TAKING THE MONEY
1426,THE BOY WAS SHAKING WITH FEAR BUT THE ACHYMIS HELPED HIM OUT OF THE TENTS
1427,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
1428,BUT ARMS CANNOT BE DRAWN UNLESS THEY ALSO GOT INTO BOTTLE
1429,HE HAD SEEN THE SHOOTING STAR AND WAS PERSUADED THAT A METEORITE LAY SOMEWHERE NEAR BY
1430,MAYBE WE ARE ALL THAT WAY THE BOY MUSED

1437,THE SHOP IS EXACTLY THE SIZE I ALWAYS WANTED IT TO BE
1438,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS MACK SACK A BOTTLE OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
1439,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW OF THE PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT ASTRONOMY
1440,DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINION SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNEW WHO IS LISTENING

1447,I POINTED OUT MARS A BRIGHT DAWT OF LIGHT
1448,THE MONK LAUGH WHEN HE SAW ME COME BACK IN TATTERS
1449,ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS TO BE SINCERE
1450,I HEARD A PECULIAR HUMMING SOUND FROM THE PIT
1451,THE ONLY SHADOW WAS THAT OF THE FEW SCATTERED PINE TREES
1452,THE SUN SAWED ABOUT ZIT AND DECIDED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY
1453,THEY OW IT O LIKE THERE BUT ALL WE

1462,I THOUGHT THE AND SKIRRING MIGHT BE ONTEMATTIC
1463,IT MADE ME VERY DEPRESSED
1464,IT'S A CODE SAID THE BOY A BIT DISAPPOINTED
1465,I AM IN SEARCH OF THAT UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE AMONG OTHER THINGS
1466,MISTER LEE CAN'T BE BOTHERED NOW

1478,IT'S NOT GOING VERY FAR THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE HORSEMEN
1479,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GASFLORD
1480,SOMETHING INSIDE THE CYLINDER WAS UN SCREWING THE TOP
1481,THE OLD MAN KNEW HOW TO READ AND HAD ALREADY READ THE BOOK
1482,THE TWO MEN HURRIED BACK AND FOUND THE CYLINDER STILL LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
1483,AND THIS IS FOR ME SAID THE ALCHAMIST KEEPING ONE OF THE PARTS
1484,THEN A MAN APPROACHED
1485,JUST HINOWING THEM MADE HIM FEEL BETTER
1486,BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
1487,I WENT A STRAIGHT TO MY LEGS CLUMSILY AND FEELING MY RAIN THE DARK
1488,BUT WHERE ARE THE HOUSES

1525,FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMMENSITY OF VACANCY
1526,SOME MEN WERE SMOKING FROM A GIGANTIC PIPE THAT THEY PASSED FROM ONE TO FRONT TO THE OTHER
1527,BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THEM THE BOY ANSWERED SAYING NOTHING ABOUT HIS DREAM
1528,WE ARE GOING TO LAST ON LIKE YOU

1540,THE DOOR WAS LOCKED
1541,THERE ARE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED

1543,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
1544,THE WARTERIS GRACIOUS HERI TEPAT
1545,I WAS JUST IN TOWN EARLIER THIS YEAR SO IT IS KIND OF CRAZY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT TOOK PLACE RIGHT AFTER
1546,IT SPREAD THROUGH THE PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE AND OBSCURED ITS MORE FAMILIAR FEATURES
1547,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE THERE IN THE BLACKNESS WITH PATCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
1548,HE KNEW HE WAS STRONGER THAN HIS FRIEND
1549,AND HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE DESERT THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM TO THE WOMAN HE LOVED

2449,BUT YOU DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT CRIED NOW
2450,HE COULD ALWAYS BECOME A CRYSTAL SALSMAN AGAIN
2451,I WONDER HOW MANY TIMES A YEAR THIS HAPPENS
2452,I ENCOURAGE EVERY ONE TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR VOICE TO PROJECT COMMON VOICE
2453,I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE SHEEP ARE AFRAID OF STRANGERS
2454,A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT SEVERAL LANGUAGES WERE SPOKEN IN THE SHOP
2455,I DON'T KNOW WHY I CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
2456,HE WAS PROUD OF HIMSELF

2467,AND I AM CERTAIN YOU WILL FIND IT THE ARCHIMENT SAID
2468,THE TRIBAL CHIEFTAINS WILL SEE DAD AND YOU WILL BE DISMISSED FROM YOUR POSITION AS A COUNSELLOR
2469,LOOKING THROUGH THE TELESCOPE I SAW A CIRCLE OF DEEP BLUE AND THE LITTLE ROUND PLANET
2470,IT WAS A STRANGE FURNACE FUELLED BY FIRWOOD WITH ITS TRANSPARENT GLASKADIN ON THE TOP
2471,I DIDN'T FALL IN
2472,CAN I AT LEAST KEEP THE ONION SOUP
2473,HE WAS OLDER AND WAS CARRYING A SMALL BUCKET
2474,THERE WAS A THUD LIKE THE FALL OF A GREAT MASS

2476,WHO DO YOU FEEL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT
2477,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA

2484,THE TWO MEN HURIED BACK AND FOUND THE SINATORS TWO LYING IN THE SAME POSITION
2485,MY WIFE POINTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
2486,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GUY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AND FIGHTING HE IS
2487,MY FATHER FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM

2489,I COULDN'T WORK IN THE CITY
2490,HE JUST TOO OTO THE BANK
2491,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER WAS SURE THAT SHE HAD PROBABLY MARRIED
2492,IT WAS NO MORE EXCITING THAN AN OVERTURNED CARRIAGE OR A TREE BLOWN ACROSS THE ROAD
2493,BUT THE ENGLISHMAN WAS EXALTED
2494,THERE MUST BE A LANGUAGE THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON WORDS THE BOY THOUGHT
2495,THE ULTAR'S ATTENTIV FACIAL EXPRESSION WAS CONVINCING THE JURY
2496,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME WAN THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COMEDOWN

2501,THE BOY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT WHEN HE RETURNED FROM EGYPT ET WOULD BUY THAT SWORD
2502,I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE THINGS LEFT TO BE TRANSMITTED BY WOD OF MOUTH HE THOUGHT
2503,AND ONE OR TWO PERSONS WERE RETURNING

2607,ANOTHER SOUNDS INSIDET HAD STAPPED
2608,MARGARED LOOKED TELEGRAMS
2609,ONLY IT WOULD BE A LORD EASIER WITH YOU

2687,THE BURNING FIRE HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED
2688,SOMETHING BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENTARILY BLINDED
2689,I THOUGHT TO NIGHT I'D PUT MISS KELLEY THERE
2690,THE BOY MUMBLED AN ANSWER THAT ALLOWED HIM TO AVOID RESPONDING TO HER QUESTION
2691,BUT YOU WILL LOVE HER AND SHA'LL RETURN YOUR LOVE

2735,THE CAMEL DRIVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE BOY WAS SAYING
2736,IT'S EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE'S NO INFORMATION ABOUT BRAINS THAT DIDN'T COME FROM A BRAIN
2737,HE QUICKLY PULLED HIS HANDS AWAY
2738,CWUNOVER AND JOIN O PADY
2739,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT

2782,IT DIDN'T BRING WITH IT THE SMELL OF THE DESERT NOR THE THREAD OF MOORISH INVASION IT DIDN'T BRING WITH IT THE SMELL OF THE DESERT NOR THE THREAT OF MOORISH INVASION
2783,HE LIVES AT THE ALPAYUM OASIS HIS FRIEND HAD SAID

2796,IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO TALK
2797,HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU GOIN UP HOME
2798,THE BOY PUT THE STONES IN HIS POUCH
2799,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY OUR ALUBENAI OR PROSPECTIVE STUDENT
2800,I HAVE THE DIET OF A KID WHO FOUBED TWENTY DOLLARS
2801,THIS CAN AROUSE NATIONAL INTEREST
2802,THERE WAS HARDLY ANY MOVEMENT FROM THE PIT
2803,BUT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
2804,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
2805,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES I WENT OFF BACK TO THE TOWN AGAIN TO K HELP
2806,THE CAREATOUST AUTHORITY ON NITIORIDES STATED THAT THE AID OF ITS FIRST EFFERENCE WAS ABOUT MINTHY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
2807,ONCE TO THE THIEF AT ONCE TO THE GENERAL
2808,BECAUSE OF THE ALMONDS THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED

2816,EVERYBODY QUIET AND READY FOR AN EMERGENCY
2817,SPEAK TO THE HAND THAT WROTE IT ALL SAID THE SON
2818,AND THE SAND AND GRAVEL HAD BEEN FLUNG VIOLENTLY IN EVERY DIRECTION
2819,BUT BAKERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT PEOPLE THAN SEPARATE

2823,I MAKE MY LIVING FOR CASTING THE FUTURE FOR PIPLU HE THAT
2824,I AM GOING AWAY HE SAID
2825,HE APPROACHED THE MASS AND WAS SURPRISED AT THE SIZE AND THE SHAPE

2828,IT IS I WHO DARED TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
2829,DENIERS AT THE UNIVERSITY AND HERE I AM IN A CORRAL

2831,THE ENGLISHMAN ASKED IF THEY WERE IN DANGER
2832,THE REFERENCES ARE GOOD IN THE VERY NARROW AREA OF HISTOGRAND METHODS
2833,IN SOME PLACES THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE SALT OF DRIED UP LAKES
2834,HERE IS PLANNING AS HE LEFT THE BAR
2835,IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY WHEN ALL OF SPAIN SLEPT DURING THE SUMMER
2836,BUT NO VIER COULD HE FIND HIS NEW COMPATIOM

3229,THE BOY WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT HIS FRIEND HAD SIMPLY BECOME SEPARATED FROM HIM BY ACCIDENT
3230,NO THE ALCHYMIST ANSWERED
3231,THE BOY WAS STARTLED
3232,THE FOLLOWING NIGHT THE BOY APPEERED AT THE ALCHEMIS'S TENT WITH THE HORSE
3233,HE STOOD SILENT AND MOTIONLESS REGARDING ME
3234,I'M BEGINNING TO REALIZE THAT
3235,IT WAS AS IF IT QUIVERED BUT REALLY THIS WAS THE TELESCOPE VIBRATING
3236,IT WAS JUST AS YOU COULDN'T GRASP WHAT WAS MAS
3237,VICKIY WANTED TO NOT MAKE A SPECTACLE OF HERSELF
3238,HENDERSON STOOD UP WITH A SPADE IN HIS HAND
3239,BUT I FELT MISERABLE WATCHING HIM WITHER AWAY LIKE A SHRIVELLED DANDELIAN
3240,YOU ALREADY KNOW ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
3241,YOU CAN HEAR OUT OF IT
3242,SHE AND THE JUDGE ARE LIKE CON BEEF AND CABBAGE
3243,WE'VE DONE IT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN WHO HAD ALSO AWAKENED EARLY
3244,HE FELT UNSAFE LIKE DARRING HIS FIRST BLESS ON UNDRIVING SCHOOL

3247,THAT MAN IS TERRIFIC
3248,MY SEVEN YEAR RESIMEGAP IS MARKED NOT DRUGS
3249,ON RAINY DAYS I WILL PLAY INSIDE
3250,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
3251,THE PEOPLE WERE ALSO PRAYING TO HEAVEN FOR PROTECTION
3252,THE PEOPLE WILL ENJOY THE TEA AND WANT TO BUY THE GLASSES
3253,THE TOP HAD CERTAINLY CEASED TO ROTATE
3254,ALTOTY TO NIGHT
3255,BUT IT IS NOT A CLASS THAT WAS REQUESTED BY ARALUMNI OR RESPECTIVE STUDENTS
3256,ANOTHER RUN ON THE BANK
3257,THOSE ARE THE RULES OF WAR THE LEADER EXPLAINED
3258,TRUST IN YOUR HEART BUT NEVER FORGET THAT YOU ARE IN THE DESERT
3259,WELL THEN WHY DO WE NEED ALL THESE BOOKS THE BOY ASKED
3260,MEANWHILE THE BOY THOUGHT ABOUT HIS TREASURE
3261,AND LOOK HOW MANY THINGS THE WIND ALREADY KNEW HOW TO DO
3262,STORM INCREASING OVER THE ROCKIES
3263,DON'T BE IMPATIENT HE REPEATED TO HIMSELF
3264,SADLY MY DREAM OF BECOMING A SQUIRREL WHISPERER MAY NEVER HAPPEN
3265,THIS WAS THE STRANGEST OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER CAME TO AITH FROM OUTER SPACE
3266,HER OLD MAN WAS DOCK MITCHELL
3267,I'D LACK YOU TO TAKE ME THERE IF YOU CAN
3268,THE OASIS IS NEUTRAL GROUND
3269,HE PREPARED HIMSELF A SANDWICH AND DRANK SOME HOT TEA FROM A CRYSTAL GLASS
3270,THE STREAMER OF GAS CAME OUT TOWARDS US
3271,IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT MONEY CAN SAVE SOME ONE'S LIFE
3272,THEY MOUNTED THEIR HORSES AND RODE OUT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERMITS OF EGYPT
3273,IT WAS SUCH A GRADUAL MOVEMENT THAT HE FOUND IT ONLY BY NOTICING THE DOTS
3274,TO STUFF INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS
3275,I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU
3276,CAN I GET A HOPFUL
3277,I'LL JUST WATCH HIM HE SAID TO HIMSELF
3278,THE ENGLISHMAN WAS DISAPPOINTED
3279,AS THE ENGLISHMAN LEFT FATIMA ARRIVED AND FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER
3280,IT SEEMED SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
3281,THE RECTANGLE WAS PARALLEL TO THE SQUARE
3282,I FEEL SO GOOD I COULD SPECT
3283,AN COVER UP THAT TRANSMITTE
3284,TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM
3285,THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR MINE

3287,ELLI WON FIRST PRIZE IN THE SPELLING COMPETITION
3288,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN IN MARS
3289,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
3290,NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE CANDIDATE
3291,WOULD YOU LIKE A CAPACINO
3292,COULD ALWAYS GO BACK TO BEING SHEPHER
3293,MANY TELESCOPES WERE PINED A HAT IT
3294,NO DOUBT THE IMPACT HAD CAUSED THE SPECIAL FIRE
3295,LIKE EVERYBODY LONS HE SAID
3296,THE END OF THE CYLINDER WAS STILL AS AJILRI AND HENDERSHON HAD LEFT IT
3297,THE FINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY WAS A BOOKKEEPER FOR FOURTEEN YEARS
3298,HE WAS DRESSED ONLY IN HIS PAJAMAS
3299,WHAT TIME IS IT
3300,THE HORSEMAN WAS COMPLETELY IN MOBEY AS WAS THE BOY
3301,AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE CROSSING MY SHAW ALL THE TIME HIDING FOR MAKA AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE WERE POSSING MY SHAWL ALL THE TIME HIDING FOR MAKA WOSTOP
3302,E CAN ONLY SPIT OUT SO MANY SEEDSS
3303,A LARGE PIECE SUDDENLY CAME OFF AND FELL THE FALOAT AND SHARP KNOSSE

3305,SOMEBODY HAD RETURNED MY LOST CREDIT CARD TO THE BANK
3306,AN THE FALKEN THEND NOURISHES MAN

3310,THE ENGLISHMAN'S EYES LIT UP
3311,I O TO WORK
3312,THEY STOOD THERE LOOKING AT THE MOON
3313,THE CAMEL DRIVER THOUGH SEEMED NOT TO BE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF WAR
3314,IT'S TOO BAD THAT HE IS QUICKLY GOING TO FORGET MY NAME HE THOUGHT
3315,THE WATER CONTINUED AND AT TIMES THE WIND GARRIED THE SUITE SICK LEAS MY LOW BLOOD
3316,I CAN CLEAN OUP THOSE GLASSES IN THE WINDOW IF YOU WANT SAID THE BOY
3317,THE FACT THAT THE TWO HOURS HAD STRETCHED INTO AN ENTIREIER NIN MATTER
3318,NOW HE WAS HERE NOT WITH HIS FLOCK BUT WITH A SHOVEL
3319,HE HOPED THAT YOU WOULD BE SOME ONE AS CAPABLE AS HIS PREVIOUS APPRENTICE
3320,THE ENGLISHMEN ASKED IF THERE WERE IN DANGER
3321,I KNOW VERY WELL WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
3322,THE CANNEL DRIVER WAS NOT A FIGHTER AND HE HAD CONSULTED WITH SEERS
3323,IT WAS ONLY WHEN I GOT THIS CLOSE TO IT THAT THE STRANGENESS OF IT WAS AT ALL EVIDENT TO ME
3324,EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SAME HAND
3325,FOR AT THAT TIME IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE HOLLOW
3326,DOES SHE HAVE THE MONEY
3327,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANY ONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURGER HELPER
3328,WE NEED TO RUN
3329,HE WAS SELLING BETTER THAN EVER
3330,THEN HE DROPPED HIS SPADE PICKED UP HIS JACKET AND CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD
3331,YOU CAN'T BE THE WIN THE WIND SAID
3332,THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SO PROFOUND THAT IT SEEMED THE CITY WAS ASLEEP
3333,I'M GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE

3336,YOU HAVE ENOUGH GO TO BY MANY SHEEP IND MANY CAMELS

3338,HIS NAME IS WELSH
3339,ENOUGH SAID THE BOY
3340,HEE IS TRYING TO DREAK YOU AGAIN
3341,I TOLD HIM WE COULD TEACH HER TO IGNORE PEOPLE WHO WASTE HER TIME
3342,THE SERPENT RELAXED IMMEDIATELY
3343,IT'S CALLED THE PRINCIPLE OF FAVOURABILITY
3344,ONE MUST PREPARE FOR IT
3345,BUT HE DIDN'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW
3346,FOR EVERY TEN DEAD MEN AMONG OUR ENEMIES YOU WILL RECEIVE A PIECE OF GOLD
3347,WHY SHOULDN'T I MAKE FATHER MY BENEFICIARY
3348,IT LOOKED LIKE A RASTY GAS FLOW
3349,WHAT HE APE

3355,THE BOY LOOKED AROUND FOR THE OVENS AND OTHER APPARATUS USED IN ALCHEMY BUT SAW NONE
3356,THERE WERE RAISED VOICES AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLING APPEARS TO BE GOING ON
3357,BUT KROW TILTED IS HEAD AS IF IT WAS THINKING
3358,EVERYTHING I DO IS FRIENDLY
3359,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT TENDERSON'S HOUSE
3360,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING

3384,ABSOLUTELY DESPICABLE FOR GINGERBRED MEN ARE FORCED TO LIVIN OUSES MADE OF THEIR OWN FLESH
3385,AND HE VANISHED AROUND THE CORNER OF THE PLAZA
3386,AT THE FIRST GLANCE IT WAS REALLY NOT VERY EXCITING
3387,MOST MEDIORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
3388,FROM THE RAILWAY STATION IN THE DISTANCE CAME THE SOUND OF TRAIN SRINGING AND RUMBLING EH
3389,THEY SHOUTED CONSOLATION AND PROMISES AND WENT OFF BACK INTO THE TOWN AGAIN TO GET HELP
3390,IF YOU START YOUR EMALES WITH GREETINGS LET ME BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO EARTH
3391,WHY DO THEY NEED JIM
3392,I LEFT MY FATHER MY MODA AND THE TOWN CASTLE BEHIND
3393,BEFORE THE SUN HAD REACHED ITS HIGH POINT FIVE HUNDRED TRIBESMEN APPEARED ON THE HORIZON
3394,THE GREATEST AUTHORITY ON WICH WRIGHTS STATED THAT THE HEIGHT OF ITS FIRST APPEARANCE WAS ABOUT NINETY OR ONE HUNDRED MILES
3395,IT IS I WHO DARE TO DO SO SAID THE BOY
3396,HE DECIDED TO STAY RIGHT THERE AND AWAIT HIS RETURN
3397,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FOLLED MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
3398,TOWARD THE AND OF THE AFTERNOON THEY CAME UP UPON ACOPTIC MONASCERI
3399,I DON'T WANT ANYTHING ELSE IN LIFE

3414,PUT DOWN THAT CHAIR
3415,ONLY WHEN HECONSENTS
3416,SHE FELT LIKE A WEAKLING IN COMPARISON TO HER NEW BORN DAUGHTER
3417,KRASMIN WALKED ALONGSIDE THE CANNEL
3418,ALL THE JOY HE HAD SEEN THAT MORNING HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED
3419,WHO'S THE TEN FOR

3421,MECA IS A LOT FARTHER AWAY FROM THE PYRAMIDS
3422,BUT FOR I BOT I WANT A DINNER ON ATILLI

3424,THE BOY WAS EMBARRASSED AND CONFESSED THAT HE HAD OBSERVED NOTHING

3426,WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED HE ASKED THE ENGLISHMAN ONE NIGHT
3427,DON'T YOU KNOW THERE'S A WAR ON
3428,WHY DON'T WE SEARCH THEIR ROOMS
3429,THE BOY KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY
3430,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
3431,HE HAD ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT THE SHEEP WERE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HE SAID
3432,HE THOUGHT OF THE MERCHANT'S DAUGHTER AND WAS SURE THAT SHE WAS PROBABLY MARRIED
3433,BUT I AM GOING TO EGYPT DE BOY SAID
3434,EXPERIMENTS ARE UNCONVENCING
3435,HE PUT ASIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEN WENT TO A SMALL CAFENI MAR
3436,IS IT A DEAL OR ISN'T IT
3437,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
3438,WHEN HE SPEAKS IN OUR LANGUAGE I CAN INTERPRET WHAT HE HAS SAID
3439,IT WAS HIS HEART THAT WOULD TELL HIM WHERE HIS TREASURE WAS HIDDEN
3440,I'LL TAKE MINE NOW
3441,THE CONCRETE WAS COVERED IN MOSS
3442,IT'S THE MAS TO WORK IN THE ALCHANISTS
3443,MATHISD ATTEMPTING IT WAS MY FEAR OF FAILURE THAT FIRST KEPT ME FROM ATTEMPTING THE MASTERWORK
3444,I'LL SEE YOU GET IT IN FIFTEEN MINUTES
3445,WITH EVERY DAY THAT PASSED THE BOY'S HEART BECAME MORE AND MORE RESILENT
3446,YOU ARE WISE BECAUSE YOU OBSERVE EVERYTHING FROM A DISTANCE THE BOY SAID
3447,BUT THERE'S A TRIBE IN WAR THE BOY REITERATED
3448,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS MEANT
3449,IN ANY CASE THE DESERT WAS IMPASSABLE
3450,BUT HE KEPT QUIET BECAUSE HE HAD HEARD WHAT THE ALCHEMIST SAID TO THE MONK
3451,HOW DO YO KNOW SHE DIDN'T
3452,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND LIFE IN THE DESERT THE BOY SAID
3453,AT THAT POINT IN THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING IS CLEAR AND EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE
3454,YOU GOT YOUR SEA LEGS YET
3455,ON THE SECOND DAY THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A CLIFF NEAR THE CAMP
3456,WHY DO YOU WANT TO SAVE ME
3457,GIVE ME THE DISTRICT ATTORNE'S OFFICS
3458,BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
3459,BUT HE HAD FOUND A GUIDE AND DIDN'T WANT A MISS OUT ON AN OPPORTUNITY
3460,HE JUST GOT A NEW KITE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
3461,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
3462,I JUST DON'T TRUST ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY'VE NEVER HAD HAMBURG OR HELPER

3469,THE BOY STOOD UP SHAKILY AND LOOKED ONCE MORE AT THE PYRAMIDS
3470,BECAUSE I DON'T LEAVE IN EITHER MY PAST OR MY FUTURE
3471,THEN SHE FILLED HER VESSEL WITH WATER AND LEFT
3472,EVERY PURCHASE IS A VOTE
3473,MY REVIEW OF THE SUN ONE STAR
3474,THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE UPPER WINDOWS OF THE HOUSES WHEN THE PEOPLE WENT TO BED
3475,DOWN BELOW IN THE DARKNESS WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN PEACE
3476,HE WAS MORE CONFIDENT IN HIMSELF THOUGH AND HE FELT AS THOUGH HE COULD CONQUER THE WARRIOR
3477,THEY HAD GONE AWAY TO BREAKFAST AT HENDERSON'S HOUSE
3478,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
3479,HE'S ON THE WAY
3480,WATER BOARDING IS A TERRIBLE FORM OF TORTURE
3481,IAMD GOING TO PUT HER THROUGH COLLEGE
3482,HE MOVED ABOUT INVISIBLE BUT EVERY ONE COULD HEAR HIM
3483,WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE AMERALD TABLET THE BOY WANTED TO KNOW
3484,HOW ABOUT THAT ONE THERE
3485,BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING

3505,FIRST THEY TRIED TO FIND HIM IN THEIR ING
3506,THE SUN WAS TURNED INTO A GOLDEN DISC
3507,STRANGE IMAGES PASSED FROM MY MIND
3508,THEN HE TOOK FROM HIS KNEPSACK A BOWL OF WINE AND DRANK SOME
3509,THIS IS THE MAYOR
3510,IT SEEMED AS IF WHAT THE OLD KING HAD CALLED BEGGINER'S LUCK WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING
3511,YOU DIDN'T VOTE FOR ME THE LAST TIME
3512,I GOT DRUNK YESTERDAY AND THOUGHT I BUILT A SUPER COMPUTER
3513,EVERYTHING'S GETTING COLD AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

3521,THE BOY WAS ALSO SADDENED HIS FRIEND WAS IN PURSUIT OF HIS DESTINY
3522,IT'S SATURDAY IT'S HOT AND I REALLY WANT TO DRY THE DRY RAMIN
3523,AN ELEPHANT IN THE ROOF IS SOON AN ELEPHANT IN THE HOUSE
3524,WHY THE SHOTS STOP AFTER THE TEN TO ONE O NURT HAS TRIED TO EXPLAIN
3525,HE GOT UP EARLY WITH THE IDEA OF FINDING IT
3526,HE HAS OTHER THINGS TO DO FIRST
3527,HE PUT A SIGN ON THE DOOR AND THEY WENT TO A SMALL CAFE NEAR BY
3528,DON'T SHARE YOUR OPINION SO READILY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS LISTENING
3529,PAHEDTA EVERYONE HAS GARRI BEAUSE'S TEETH DRA BEGAN
3530,AS FAST AS I CAN
3531,NOW I CAN SEE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO BAD
3532,IT MAY BE THE GUESSES OF THE FIRING THAT COWS THE MARTIANS IN CONVENIENCE
3533,THEY LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THEIR LABORATORIES AND TRY TO REBOL AS GOLD HAD
3534,WE BEAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THAT STORY
3535,YOU SHOULD SEE THE OTHER GAY SPECIFICALLY HOW GOOD AT FIGHTING HE IS
3536,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
3537,I REMEMBER HOW I SAT ON THE TABLE DAY IN THE LATNUS PATCHES OF GREE AND GRUMSON SWIMMING BEFORE MY EYES
3538,NOBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THE MILITARY HAS IN ITS CHECK POINT
3539,I NEVER SAID I TAKE IT
3540,BUT THAT WAS SIMPLY BECAUSE MY EYE WAS TURT
3541,IT SEEMED SUCH A LITTLE THING SO BRIGHT AND SMALL AND STILL
3542,THE HADDER WAS ON FIRED AND HE COULD SEE A THIN BLUE SMOKE WRITING UP SLUWRY
3543,IN ANY CASE IT'S GOOD THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED THAT EVERYTHING IN LIFE HAS ITS PRICE
3544,THEY WERE TRIBESMEN DRESSED IN BLUE WITH BLACK RINGS SURROUNDING THEIR TURBANS
3545,NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT NIGHT
3546,HUMMING DOWN THE BLOCK IS THE BIGGEST STEAM ROLLER I AVE EVER SEEN
3547,BUT ONLY SPEAK A WORD AND MY SERVANT WILL BE HEALED
3548,WHEN I HAD MY SHEEP I WAS HAPPY AND I MADE THOSE AROUND ME HAPPY

3552,AMPETA STILL TO BE ALONE WITH ONE'S BOOK
3553,HE ASKED IT PLEASE NEVER TO STOP SPEAKING TO HIM
3554,IT'S CRAWLING WITH CORPSE OUTSIDE
3555,BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING
3556,SOME STORMS ARE WORTH THE WRECKAGE
3557,I REMEMBER GRANDPA PAW LOOKING THROUGH IT
3558,GET MARTIN OUT OF CHAIL

3574,THEY LOOKED FOR THE FULL MASS BUT FOUND NOTHING
3575,UNTIL THEN HE CONSIDERED THE ALMONDS TO BE THINGS OF THIS WORLD
3576,NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME
3577,AS SOON AS HE SAW ME AMONG THE CROWD HE CALLED TO ME TO COME DOWN
3578,IT DOESN'T HAVE TO RHIME
3579,HISTORY TISNISS THE SAME AS MINE NOR MIN AS HIS
3580,I UNDERSTAND SHEEP THEY ARE NO LONGER A PROBLEM AND THEY CAN BE GOOD FRIENDS
3581,YOU CAN VERTIFY AND REALAT ORD YOUR OWD RECORDINGS BEFORE SUBMITTING THAT

3905,WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP OUR CLUB
3906,FROM THEN NON HE WOULD MAKE HIS OWN DECISIONS
3907,HE MUST BE DISGUISED TO AVOID ENCOUNTERS WITH THEVE
3908,HIS HANDS WERE ABRAITED AND EXHAUSTED BUT HE LISTENED TO HIS HART

3910,AND BECAUSE THE TRIBES DECLARED WAR I WENT TO THE WELL SEEKING THE ALCHYMIST

3921,I DON'T KNOW THAT VOICE ANYWHERE
3922,THEY COULD BARELY SEE THE BOY
3923,THEY SET OFF RUNNING WILDLY INTE THE TREES
3924,BUT INSTEAD OF BEING SADDENED HE WAS HAPPY
3925,OTHER SERVANTS MAINTAIN THE FIRES IN THE HOOKARS

3933,HE RESTOUTED HIS EFFORTS FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME
3934,IN THOSE DAYS VERY FEW PEOPLE HAD ANY IDEA ABOUT YES MAMMA
3935,IT LOOKED LIKE A RUSTY GAS FLOAT
3936,THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAD PREPARED EVERYONE FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE IDEA
3937,BUT THE MARKET PLEDGE WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS FAR FROM HIGHLAND SO HE WIMPED
3938,THE SHOWERS IN THERE
3939,AND DON'T FORGET THE LANGUAGE OF OMENS
3940,MOST METEORITES ARE MORE OR LESS ROUNDED
3941,I WONDER WHAT'S EATING THAT OLD MUDDY GRUBBING BUZZARD ANYWAY
3942,I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO MY MOTHER HOW TO GET BICTURES OF FOL
3943,I'M DYING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE

3945,ASYMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY USES PAIRS OF KEYS
3946,IT SEEMS SO SAFE AND TRANQUIL
3947,I AM GETTING OUT OF HERE AND YOU CAN STOP ME
3948,YOU THINK IWAS ON THE WITNESS STAND
3949,WITH A BAG OF MARSH MELLOWS
3950,AND HE TOLD WHAT HE HAD SEEN
3951,IF SOME ONE ISN'T WHAT OTHERS WANT THEM TO BE THE OTHERS BECOME ANGRY
3952,THE TELLER DIDN'T HOV OVE CHAIN
3953,SAMSEN BRIGHT REFLECTED FROM HIS CHEST WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT THE BOY WAS MOMENAN MOMENTARILY BLIND

3959,BUT THEN I REALIZED SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
3960,EXACTLY ANSWERED THE ALCHEMIST
3961,OR A MAN INTO THE WIND
3962,THE BOY REMINDED THE OLD MAN THAT HE HAD SAID SOMETHING ABOUT HIDDEN TREASURE
3963,NO SENSE IN GOING UP THERE
3964,IT SEEMED HE HAD MADE THE LONG JOURNEY FOR NOTHING
3965,ITS LOWER END WAS STILL EMBEDDED
3966,THE HELDER SERVANTS MAINTAINED THE FIRE IN THE OUCAS
3967,AFTER ALL HE HAD ALL HIS MONEY
3968,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT THE VISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION
3969,IN SPITE OF THIS I STILL BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE MEN AN MARS
3970,CREDIERTIS STAR SOMETHING EXCLUSE YOU TO UMANS
3971,I'LL RETURN JUST AS YOUR FATHER CAME BACK TO YOUR MOTHER HE SAID
3972,THEN SHE TOOK BOTH OF HIS HANDS IN HERS AND BEGAN QUIETLY TO PLAY
3973,THESE TROUSERS DON'T FIT VERY WELL
3974,BUT I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO GET TO WORK BECAUSE OF THE INVESTIGATIONS
3975,IT HAD A DIAMETER OF ABOUT THIRTY YARDS
3976,AFTER ALL WHO DOESN'T WANT TO OVERCOME NEW CHALLENGES AND CHIEF GREAT HATES
3977,STRONG PASSWORDS DON'T HAVE TO BE HARD TO REMEMBER
3978,ALWAYS ASK AN OBJECTIVE QUESTION
3979,HE WASN'T ASKING FOR HELP
3980,THAT'S WI AM HERE
3981,MY WIFE POUNTED OUT TO ME THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE RED GREEN AND YELLOW SIGNAL LIGHTS
3982,THE BOY SMILED AND CONTINUED DIGGIN
3983,YOU CAN GET AROUND VERY EASILY BY TRAIN WHICH IS A VERY RELAXING AND AFFORDABLE WAY TO TRAVEL
3984,WHAT KIND OF A PROOF IS THAT
3985,YOU MEAN YOU DON'T APPOV OF MY HAVING A BEEN

3992,THE LEAD HAD DRIED INTO THE SHAPE OF THE PAN BUT IT WAS NO LONGER LEAD
3993,HE WAS IMMENSELY EXCITED AT THE NEWS
3994,HE SAT LOOKING AT THE SKY FOR A LONG TIME
3995,AND HE WASN'T VERY MUCH BETTER
3996,EVEN THEN HE HARDLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HIS AND
3997,BUT I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT CONTAINED ANY LIVING CREATURE
3998,NOW THAT'S TOO MUCH
3999,OGULE WATCHED TILL ONE AND THEN GAVE UP
4000,GIVE HER THE WORKS
4001,GOTRU WITH WHAT

4006,I WOULD HAVE WON THE JUNIORAL IN FIXIVE NOT FOR THOSE MEDDLING KIDS
4007,HE WANTED TO FORGET ABOUT TE FISION AND RETURNED TO HIS MEDITATION
4008,GO INTO YOUR DANCE
4009,ALTHOUGH SIAKING IN BINERY SIRC TREES IS A FICIENT YOU WON'T FIND ANY FRUIT IN THERE
4010,THERE WERE RAISED VOICE AND SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE APPEARED TO BE GOING ON
4011,I HAD SEEN ALL THAT IT WOULD PRESENTLY BRING ME
4012,HOW DID YOU LEARN TO READ THE GIRL ASKED AT ONE POINT
