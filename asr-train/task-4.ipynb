    "- To improve model performance, consider utilizing larger datasets. This can be achieved by incorporating publicly available datasets like LibriSpeech, VoxForge, and Common Voice (including other languages), or by combining the existing dataset with other relevant sources to increase both size and diversity of training data.\n",

    "- Data augmentation techniques such as speed perturbation (slightly increasing or decreasing playback speed) and volume variations (randomly adjusting audio volume) help the model generalize better to different speaking styles and recording conditions. \n",
    "- Furthermore, adding background noise (e.g., white noise, babble noise) to the audio during training simulates noisy environments, enhancing the model's ability to accurately transcribe speech in challenging acoustic conditions.\n",
    "3. Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "- Techniques like grid search, random search can be employed to systematically explore different learning rate values and identify the setting that yields the best results on a validation set."
